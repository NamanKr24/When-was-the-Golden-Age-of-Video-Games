# When was the Golden Age of Video Games

## Description

Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by 2027 according to Mordor Intelligence. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games already passed?

## Objective

In this project, I've explored the top 400 best-selling video games created between 1977 and 2020. I've compared a dataset on game sales with critic and user reviews to determine which were the best years for video games.

## Usage

The findings have been discussed in the 'Report' HTML file along with the results.
